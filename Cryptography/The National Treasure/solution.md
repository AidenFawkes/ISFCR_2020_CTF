Let's have a little recap of one of the cult classics.
Here we have an Ottendorf Cipher and we will use the same Benjamin Franklin's Silence Dogood letters ( https://www.kalh.org/silence.pdf ).
Can you decrypt it just like the movies?

The ciphers are Dogood Letter No - Line Number - Alphabet Number (ignoring spaces and special character)
 The python script gets alphabet number. Line number was taken externally and Letter no (i.e letter no 1, letter no 2) was taken manually
