This is a story of a dinner gone very wrong. Find the flag hidden inside. Read between the words.

Underscores are not the only thing added to spaces.


Hint by the author :
" Dinner story basically two spaces is 0
  Three is 1 
  And _ is the end of a character
  So you'll get the binary code and then decode from ASCII values"
