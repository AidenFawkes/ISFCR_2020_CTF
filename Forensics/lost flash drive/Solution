system:
kali (should work on any linux distro)

commands used:
file
fdisk
mount 
mkdir

>> file lost_drive

will show its a dos/mbr partition
we cant mount directly because of MBR, we have to find offset

>> fdisk -l lost_drive

start position is 2 and sector size is 512 so we can get offset as 2*512 = 1024

>> mkdir /mnt/windows
to make a windows folder to mount in

>> mount -o loop,offset=1024 lost_drive /mnt/windows

then navigate to mnt/windows and see the folders and files, extract a zip called passwords and the ctf is in it
